### Big D

The Dallas area isn't surrounded by majestic mountains, nor does it have an ocean view, forests filled with tall trees, or roaring rivers. Smack dab in the middle of prairie land, and home to over 7.5 million folks, it's the anchor to Texas' most "[metropolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area#United_States)" area.

Fueled by a strong economy with a variety of industries, Dallas is rich in vanities like shopping, food, sports and entertainment. It's also (_IMO_) one of the friendliest big cities on the planet, where folks greet ya with a big ole _"Howdy"_ and a smile.

Jimmie Dale Gilmore nailed Dallas when he said - "_Dallas is a jewel_."

> _"Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night? Well Dallas is a jewel, oh Dallas is a beautiful sight. Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light, did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?"_
