### Summary

Use the Summary section of the weekly status report template to outline all the things that have (or haven’t) happened on your project in the past week, as well as what you expect to accomplish in the coming week.

Bullets generally work well in this section. These should be brief statements about the status of tasks, deliverables, meetings, communications, decisions, and any other important details you want to call out.

### The Past

A quick recap of what you covered in the past week.

### The Present

Notable achievements of the week + challenges encountered.

### The Future

Plans for the coming week.

### Tasks and Milestones

Take time here to share more detail about the tasks and milestones. The more detail you can provide, the better you will be. Make sure you use the table in the project status report template to call out specific items each time you send an update out to your team. This will help people read and view details easily.

| Task                | Target Date  | Detail                             |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Project Kickoff     | 12/01/2022   | Kickoff meeting with client.       |
| App scoping         | 12/02/2022   | Scoping with team on legacy apps.  |
| App implementation  | 12/06/2022   | Initial pairing session.           |

This might feel redundant based on what you highlighted in the Summary section, but think of it as just another way to list important milestones or even upcoming holidays or events that you need everyone to note in your project status update.

### Action Items

Projects are more than tasks and milestones. In fact, you typically have to track a number of to-dos or action items to meet those milestones.

Use the simple table within our weekly status report template to track anything and everything that will impact your timeline and budget. Be sure to assign ownership to each action item so everyone understands exactly what's expected of them.

### Risks and Mitigations

There's no doubt that things go wrong on projects, but they don’t have to. It’s your job to keep an eye out for issues and risks to make sure things don’t actually go wrong. You’ll want to share as much detail here as possible, and be prepared to discuss it. We created a section in the status update template to give you the ability to do so.

> __Note:__ Any client or executive who doesn't get a little freaked out by a project risk is probably too checked out. That's a risk for you!
> 
> __Also:__ You might not always track risks on your projects, but leave this section in your weekly status report anyway. It’s important for your team and stakeholders to know you’re looking for potential issues at all times. Plus, if there’s nothing there to report, you can end your status check-in on a high note.
