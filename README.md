# Solo

Solo the "[og](http://chibicode.github.io/solo)" version was previously developed, maintained and ultimately deprecated by [Shu Uesugi](https://github.com/chibicode).

> [Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo) is a Jekyll theme that supports **single-page websites** only, but supports them well. Yes, it's responsive. - _[Shu Uesugi](https://github.com/chibicode)_

I'm a Solo fan, so much that I'm continuing development. I find being able to generate single page docs with a bit of style incredibly useful.

Goals for continuing Solo:

* Keep living the Solo dream, support one and only one page.
* Keep it simple.
* Make it customizable.
