# Yolo

Yolo is a single page theme cut from the cloth of "[Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo)" which was previously developed and ultimately deprecated by [Shu Uesugi](https://github.com/chibicode).

__Goals for Yolo:__

* __Keep living the Solo dream__: Support one and only one page.
* __Keep it simple__: No dependencies other than [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* __Make it customizable__: Bring your own colors and fonts.

The one and only one "implementation" page is [`index.md`](/index.md).

---

## Usage

* You need [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corbtastik/yolo.git
cd yolo
jekyll build
jekyll serve
```

---

## Themes

The colors, typography and site logo can be styled to your tastes. Yolo doesn't export a theme gem, nor does it implement an "according to hoyle" Jekyll theme. "Theming" for Yolo is simply accomplished by providing a theme scss file as outlined below. 

* Copy one of the examples in `_sass/yolo/themes` to a new scss file.
* Provide color values for each variable.
* Enable by setting `style` in `_config.yml`.

### Tips

* __Margin vs Padding:__
  * __Margin:__ Use a margin when you want to adjust the spacing of an element.
    * Margins arenâ€™t a part of the element.
  * __Padding:__ Use padding when you want to adjust the appearance of the element itself.
    * Padding is part of the element.
