# Yolo

Yolo is laser focused on static single page sites, and while anyone can Yolo, it's purposely built for writers,
techies, and picture taking folk.

> _I don't always use single-page sites but when I do, I [yolo](https://github.com/corbtastik/yolo)._

## Goals for Yolo

### 1. Live the best single page life.

Pamper single page sites like we pamper our pets.

### 2. Strive for simplicity.

No dependencies other than [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### 3. Make it customizable

Bring your own colors and fonts.
